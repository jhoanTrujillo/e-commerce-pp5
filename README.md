## Clone and Test

### Clone repo
To start cloning by following the steps below: 

- you will need the link provided by the following [github repo](https://github.com/jhoanTrujillo/e-commerce-pp5.git)
- find the folder where you would like to clone the repo.
- Use the `git clone` command follow by the link from the above step.

Once that is done you can use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements globally in your computer. 

If you would prefer to install the requirements in a virtual enviroment for the purpose of testing then follow the steps below. 

### Virtual enviroment (Venv)
To run a virtual enviroment to test the app locally follow the steps below: 

- you will need to install python virtualenv package. By using the command `pip3 install virtualenv`
- Once installed. Go to the root folder where the repo was cloned and run command: `python3 -m venv env`
- Lastly, activate the enviroment created using the following console commands:
	- On Mac: `source env/bin/activate`
	- On Windows: 
		- CMD: `env/Scripts/activate.bat `
		- Powershell: `env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 `


Once that is done, you should be able to run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements without affecting your global enviroment.
